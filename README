Fylla -- The JTAG Based Boot-Loader Loader
Charles Eidsness -- January 2, 2006

This is a simple tool that makes it possible to load a FLASH device connected
to any device with a JTAG port. It currently supports the folllowing hardware:

Processor: AMD Au1000
FLASH: Spasion SL29GLxxxM
JTAG Conection: jport via a Parallel Port (refer to jport.c for a schematic)

I've tried to write it in a way that makes it easilly updatable for different
hardware (by me at least).

The software is structured like this:

       file to send
	    |
	  fylla
	    |
	  flash
	    |
	processor
	    |
	  jstate
	    |
	  jport
	    |
    bit-stream to JTAG port

For a different processor only the processor.* files should require editting,
if the flash is different then only the flash.* files should require
editting, and if the interface between the PC and the JATG port changes then
only jport.* should require editting.

If you have any questions or comments, or if you make any modifiatcions to 
this code I'd be happy to hear about it, you can reach me at:
